# 🏠 **HOUSE PRICES - ADVANCED REGRESSION TECHNIQUES**

This project was developed as part of the Kaggle competition "[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)". The goal was to predict house sale prices using a dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing nearly every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
<br>
<br>

## 📌 **PROJECT OBJECTIVE**

Build a robust regression model capable of accurately predicting house prices using advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ensemble modeling techniques.
<br>
<br>

## 📊 **LANGUAGES AND TOOLS**

- **Programming Language**: Python;
- **Data Manipulation**: `pandas`, `numpy`;
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`;
- **Modeling**: `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, `CatBoost`, `GradientBoostingRegressor`;
- **Ensemble Modeling**: `StackingRegressor`;
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: `Optuna`;
- **Preprocessing**: `MaxAbsScaler`, `K-Fold Target Encoding`, `VIF`.
<br>

## 🧠 **PROJECT WORKFLOW**

### 1. Missing Data Handling
- Missing values were treated **case-by-case**, with contextual understanding of each feature.
- No blind imputation or mass dropping of data to preserve useful information.

### 2. Outlier Analysis
- Outliers were also evaluated **individually** to avoid discarding valuable data.
- Visual and statistical analysis were used to detect and decide on their treatment.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Target variable distribution analysis and normalization.
- **K-Fold Target Encoding** for categorical features, followed by correlation analysis with the target.
- Feature importance and redundancy evaluation using **correlation matrix** and **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**.
- **Feature Engineering** to uncover new patterns and relationships between features and the target.

### 4. Data Normalization
- Used **MaxAbsScaler** to normalize the data and maintain sparsity of the features.
<br>

## 🤖 **MODELING**

Four base models were trained and tuned:

- **LightGBM Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **CatBoost Regressor**
- **GradientBoosting Regressor**

All models underwent **hyperparameter tuning using Optuna**, a powerful optimization framework.

### 📚 Final Model - Stacking Regressor
- A **Stacking Ensemble** was built using the four models above, with **XGBoost Regressor as the meta-model**.
- Achieved a final score of **RMSE = 0.10** on the test set.

## 📈 **RESULTS**

- Final RMSE: **0.10**;
- Strong performance thanks to:
  - Feature engineering and encoding;
  - Individualized outlier/missing data treatment;
  - Model stacking and hyperparameter tuning.
<br>

## 🧠 **WHAT I LEARNED**

- Importance of **understanding data context** before applying preprocessing steps.
- **Advanced encoding** techniques like K-Fold Target Encoding.
- Combining multiple models through **stacking** for better performance.
- Effectiveness of **Optuna** for hyperparameter optimization.
<br>

## 📌 **FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**

- Add cross-validation visual analysis for each model
- Deploy the model using a simple API
- Automate the preprocessing pipeline with custom transformers
